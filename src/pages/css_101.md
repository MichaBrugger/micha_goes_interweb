# General
Link in HTML file:
```html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" />
 ```
CSS always reads from top down, last thing gets done.

Hierarchy:
```css
!important > style="" > #id > h1.class > .class > h1
```
- target everything: * {}

    used to get rid of basic styling that usually is applied

```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
border-box makes elements stay the "right" size regardless of padding etc.

- target tag: tagname{}

- target class: .class{}

- target id: #id{}

- if something is super unique: id
    if it's more general but repeats and is "grouped": class

---

- styling certain tags inside a class .class tagname {}

    looks at all tags and from those takes only the .class ones

- target list below specific class element: .class + ul {}

- target list that have specific class parent: .class > ul {}

- target nth-child of class element: .class:nth-child(n) {}
    this targets the first occurrence of class links
    
- target nth-child of list within class element: .class li:nth-child(n) {}

first value: top bottom, second value: left right
with four values its clockwise from north
```
button {
    padding: 50px 20px;
}
```

## Box Model
padding can grow element

---

## Sizing
1em = 16px (this is inheriting and multiplying)
1rem = 16px (but not inheriting)

this makes so 1 rem is 10px:
```css
html {
    font-size: 62.5%;
}
```
every other size is going to inherit from this

---

## Block vs Inline

### Inline Elements
- Inline elements don't do a line-break and are adding one the same line as long as there is space (e.g. `<a>, <img>`)
- Inline elements can't get height or width, margin works left/right but not top/bottom.
- Can be changed with `Display: block;`

#### Display: Inline-block
- Now height and width work

---

## Position

```css
html, body {
    height: 100%; //makes so empty page still has f.e. background color
}

.container {
    background: blue;
    width: 90%;
    height: 90%;
    margin: auto; //margin auto = .container is horizontally centered
}
```
### Absolute
default is static
absolute lets element ignore other elements

```css
.box {
    position: absolute; // gives access to four new properties: top, bottom, left and right
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(50%, 50%); //perfectly centered 
}
```
### Relative
when a parent has `position: relative` an element with position absolute will take the first parent of that kind and stick to those restrictions

### Fixed
will just stay at this exact position regardless of scrolling etc.

### Sticky
switches from relative to fixed as soon as it hits the border

## Pseudo-Classes

```css
button {
    padding: 2rem 4rem;
}

button:hover { // changes color when hovering the button
    background: blue;
}

button:focus { // when clicking
    background: green;
}

input:focus { // the "thing" in focus is targeted
    background: green;
```

## Pseudo-Elements

```css
h1::after {
    content: "me"; //adds "me" after every h1 element
}
```
```css
h1::before {
    content: "me"; //adds "me" before every h1 element
}
```
