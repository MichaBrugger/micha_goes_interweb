# program structure

## expressions and statements
A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression. Every value that is written literally is an expression. A program is built out of statements, which themselves sometimes contain more statements. Statements tend to contain expressions, which themselves can be built out of smaller expressions.

## bindings
To catch and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing called a binding, or variable.
After a binding has been defined, its name can be used as an expression. The value of such an expression is the value the binding currently holds.

> You should imagine bindings as tentacles, rather than boxes. They do not contain values; they grasp them—two bindings can refer to the same value. A program can access only the values that it still has a reference to. When you need to remember something, you grow a tentacle to hold on to it or you reattach one of your existing tentacles to it.

### environment
The collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time is called the environment.

### declaration

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

| Type    | Scope             | Can be redeclared? | Can be reassigned? | Hoisting Behaviour         |
| :------ | :---------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------- |
| `var`   | global & function | yes                | yes                | initialized with undefined |
| `let`   | block             | no                 | yes                | uninitialized              |
| `const` | block             | no                 | no                 | uninitialized              |

**Important:** `const` doesn't define a constant value, it defines a *constant reference* to a value, array or object. That means it can't be reassigned, but *it can be changed*.

```js
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// can't be reassigned
cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"]; // ERROR

// but the values can be changed
cars[0] = "Toyota";
```

### scope

| Type       | Definition                                                                       |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Global`   | Can be accessed from anywhere (e.g. JS document).                                |
| `Local`    | Variables in a function scope or block scope are local.                          |
| `Lexical`  | A child scope has access to data in its parent's scope (e.g. nested functions).  |
| `Block`    | Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block. |
| `Function` | The variables declared in a function is accessible in that local scope.          |

## functions
Functions are special values that encapsulate a piece of program. You can invoke them by writing functionName(argument1, argument2). Such a function call is an expression and may produce a value.

### syntax

A JS function is defined by the function *keyword*, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses **()**.

- **Parameters** are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition..
- **Arguments** are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
- The **code to be executed** by the function is placed inside curly brackets.

**Important:** Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

### conditional execution

![Controlflow](../images/controlflow-if.svg)
#### if and else
The if keyword executes or skips a statement depending on the value of a Boolean expression. The deciding expression is written after the keyword, between parentheses, followed by the statement to execute.

![ifelse](../images/controlflow-nested-if.svg)

```js
let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));
if (!Number.isNaN(theNumber)) {
  console.log("Your number is the square root of " +
              theNumber * theNumber);
} else {
  console.log("Hey. Why didn't you give me a number?");
}
```
#### while and do loops
A statement starting with the keyword _while_ creates a loop. The word while is followed by an expression in parentheses and then a statement, much like if. The loop keeps entering that statement as long as the expression produces a value that gives true when converted to Boolean.

![whiledo](../images/controlflow-loop.svg)

```js
let number = 0;
while (number <= 12) {
  console.log(number);
  number = number + 2;
}
```
A do loop is a control structure similar to a while loop. It differs only on one point: a do loop always executes its body at least once, and it starts testing whether it should stop only after that first execution. To reflect this, the test appears after the body of the loop.

```js
let yourName;
do {
  yourName = prompt("Who are you?");
} while (!yourName);
console.log(yourName);
```
This program will force you to enter a name. It will ask again and again until it gets something that is not an empty string. Applying the ! operator will convert a value to Boolean type before negating it, and all strings except "" convert to true. This means the loop continues going round until you provide a non-empty name.

#### for loops
Many loops follow the pattern shown in the while examples. First a “counter” binding is created to track the progress of the loop. Then comes a while loop, usually with a test expression that checks whether the counter has reached its end value. At the end of the loop body, the counter is updated to track progress.

Because this pattern is so common, JavaScript and similar languages provide a slightly shorter and more comprehensive form, the for loop.

```js
for (let number = 0; number <= 12; number = number + 2) {
  console.log(number);
}
```

#### breaking a loop
Having the looping condition produce false is not the only way a loop can finish. There is a special statement called break that has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop.
```js
for (let current = 20; ; current = current + 1) {
  if (current % 7 == 0) {
    console.log(current);
    break;
  }
}
```
#### switch
```js
switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
  case "rainy":
    console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
    break;
  case "sunny":
    console.log("Dress lightly.");
  case "cloudy":
    console.log("Go outside.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown weather type!");
    break;
}
```

## Objects

JavaScript objects are containers for **named values** called properties.

### Accessing Object Properties

Object values are written as *name:value* pairs. They can be accessed in two ways:

`objectName.propertyName` or `objectName["propertyName"]`

### Object Methods

Methods are **actions** that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as **function definitions**.

Example:

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
```
### The 'this' keyword
In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

In the example above, this is the **person object** that "owns" the fullName function.

## Arrays

JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array.

### Looping Array Elements

Arrays can be looped using either a `for` loop:

```js
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fLen = fruits.length;

text = "<ul>";
for (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) {
  text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>";
}
text += "</ul>";
```
or the `Array.forEach()` function:

```js
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

let text = "<ul>";
fruits.forEach(myFunction);
text += "</ul>";

function myFunction(value) {
  text += "<li>" + value + "</li>";
}
```

## The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  

In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

Warning: When using named indexes in arrays, some array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.

```js
const person = [];
person["firstName"] = "John";
person["lastName"] = "Doe";
person["age"] = 46;
person.length;     // Will return 0
person[0];         // Will return undefined
```

# HTML Events
HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

Example:
```js
<button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
```

| Event          | Definition                                          |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `onchange`     | An HTML element has been changed.                   |
| `onclick`      | The User clicks an HTML element.                    |
| `onmousehover` | The user moves the mouse over an HTML element.      |
| `onmouseout`   | The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element. |
| `onkeydown`    | The user pushes a keyboard key.                     |
| `onload`       | The browser has finished loading the page.          |
